# Script Tools

This proposal is an early design sketch by the Chrome Intelligence Team to describe the problem
below and solicit feedback on the proposed solution. It has not been approved to ship in Chrome.

Script tools is a proposal for a new web API allowing a web pages to expose their JavaScript as
tools to a browser-use AI agent. When an agent navigates to a page using this API, the page's tools
become available to help it achieve its task more directly than by simulating user input over the
human interface. A simplifying analogy would be: an MCP server implemented by a page's client code.

The explainer is split up into two parts, see the links below.
